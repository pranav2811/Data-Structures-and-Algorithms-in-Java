//It is a hierarchical data structure
//Every item in the tree is called a node
//Each node can have only one parent
//The root node does not have a parent and every tree can have only parent
 //A leafe node has no children
 //A singelton tree has only one node - the root
 //Every tree consists of one or more subtrees
 //You cant have a path that crosses a node more than once
 //depth is the number of edget is a given path
 //Height of the node is the number of edges on the longest path from the node to a leaf
 //All the nodes in the path from the root to that node are called the ancestors
