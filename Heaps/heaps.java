package Heaps;

/*
 * A complete binary tree i.e a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, 
 * is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
 *
 * Must satisy the heap property 
 * Max heap: Every parent is greater than or equal to its children
 * Min heap: Every parent is less than or equal to its children
 * 
 * Children are added at each level from left to right
 * 
 * The maximum or minimum value will always be at the root of the tree
 * Heapify: process of converting a binary tree into a heap this often has to be done with insertion or deletion
 * No required ordering between siblings
